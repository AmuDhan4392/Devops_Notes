#### What is Python ?

Python is a general purpose , high level, interpreted and dynamically typed programming language.

General Purpose – A language designed to be used for writing software in various applications domains without begin restricted to a particular domain

High level – A programming language that uses  natural language elements and automate significant areas of computing such as memory allocation

Interpreted – Python script is saved and executed in the same format in which you created the script. 

Dynamically typed – Python parser automatically infers or identifies the type of variable on the basis of what kind of data you have assigned to the variable 


#### Python Syntax compared to other programming languages 

   ##### C: - Procedural Programming
      # include <studio.h>
      int main(int arg, char ** argv)
      {
      Printf(“Hello, world!\n”);
      }

   ##### Java: Object oriented Programming
      Public class Hello
      { 
       public static void main (String argv[])
      {
      System.out.println(“Hello, world!”);
      }
      }

   ##### Python: Functional Programming
      Print(“Hello World!”)


#### Why to choose python ?

Easy to learn and understand - The syntax of the python can be easily understood even by the beginners.
Free and Open source language 
Fewer code lines, less time – Python usually involves less code which in turn results in less time to write the code.
Python is increasing becoming the top preferred language for data science, app developers, devops etc..
Huge Community – which means in case you get stuck there will be many fellow developers (quora, stack overflow)  where you can reach out for help

#### What is IDE?
	An IDE (Integrated Development Environment), a text editor with added features to support programming

   ##### Types of IDE’s:

      Rodeo
      IDLE
      Spyder
      Pycharm
      PyDev

   ##### Features of IDE’s:
      Code Editor
      Syntax Highlighter
      Auto Completion
      Debugger

#### Variables :
Which is one of the most fundamental concepts in programming,   
they are not specific to python, they exist in pretty much every programming language. 
We use variables to temporarily store data in a computer’s memory. 
Variables can be assigned with single or multiple values.

#### Keywords:
A python keyword is a reserved word which you can’t use as a name of your variable, class, function etc. 
These keywords have a special meaning and they are used for special purposes in Python programming language.

#### Creating Strings and Using them in Print Statement
 
Forming a string in python is by using quotes,  either single quotes or double quotes(‘ ‘ or “ ”). But if the string contains one, we need to use the other

#### Concept of Indentation
	
Indentation in Python refers to the (spaces and tabs) that are used at the beginning of a statement. 
The statements with the same indentation belong to the same group called a suite.

#### Function in Python:

In Python, a function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.
Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable.

      Syntax of Function
        def function_name(parameters):
           """ statement(s) ""“

Above shown is a function definition that consists of the following components.

   1. Keyword def that marks the start of the function header.
   2. A function name to uniquely identify the function. Function naming follows the same rules of writing identifiers in python.
   3. Parameters through which we pass values to a function. 
   4. A colon (:) to mark the end of the function header.
   5. One or more valid python statements that make up the function body. Statements must have the same indentation level.
